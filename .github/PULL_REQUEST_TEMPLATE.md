- *(MANDATORY - replace with a link to JIRA - e.g. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX)*

Testing Done:
- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please
specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our
coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.

Reminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):
* Your PR's title must reference an issue on 
[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). 
For example, a PR called "[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR" would close JIRA 
issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!

* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.

* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). 
Summarized as follows:
  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line

  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters
  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
